#+TITLE: dynamic window manager
#+STARTUP: overview
extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

* Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

* Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

#+begin_example
make clean install
#+end_example

* Running dwm
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

#+begin_example
exec dwm
#+end_example

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that the
DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

#+begin_example
DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm
#+end_example

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something like
this in your .xinitrc:

#+begin_example
while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
do
    sleep 1
done &
exec dwm
#+end_example

* Configuration
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code.
